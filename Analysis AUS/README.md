## **Tasks to do:**
  - Tableu interactive graphs 
  - Using social networks to measure and identify suburbs/states that are more influential in transmitting Covid-19. This would ideally allow us to measure the out-degree, in-degree, betweenness etc, to identify those suburbs that need to be kept a close attention to. 
  - Covid-19 future prevalence estimation through sample pooling strategies to greatly reduce the number of tests with only slight decrease in precision of prevalence estimates. In other words, forecasting Covid-19 prevalence based on current data.  
  - Construct random forest to predict deaths in each state on each day, using demographic characteristics of the state population and number of cases and deaths reported on each of the preceding 21 days. 
  - Assess the accuracy by training the model on case and death data collected for a few months (e.g. Feb â€“ June 2020) and then forecasting for the subsequent 21 days.
